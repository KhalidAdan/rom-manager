## Working with EmulatorJS

EmulatorJS is located in the public/ folder for easy manipulation of the emulator at runtime in dev. You can add any cores you like for RetroArch and experiment with emscripten settings.
Note: Any changes to EmulatorJS will need to be minified via public/emulatorjs/data/minify/index.js. To update emulator JS, you'll need to fetch a copy from the repo and extract it into public/.

## ROM Scanning

ROM scanning is powered by IGDB, which requires a Twitch.tv client ID. Follow the IGDB documentation to set up your API access.

## Important Notes
